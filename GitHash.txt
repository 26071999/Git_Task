GitHash:
              Git is a content-addressable filesystem. ... In its simplest form, git hash-object would take the 
             content you handed to it and merely return the unique key that would be used to store it in your Git database. 
             The -w option then tells the command to not simply return the key, but to write that object to the database.

            The git hash is made up of the following: The commit message. The file changes. The commit author
           (and committer- they can be different).

                       Using the git reflog command is also used if you want to have the history on the head of your branches.
                       With this command, you can find the line referring to the state you want to get back
