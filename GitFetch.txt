Git Fetch:

            Git "fetch" Downloads commits, objects and refs from another repository. It fetches branches 
            and tags from one or more repositories. It holds repositories along with the objects that are 
            necessary to complete their histories to keep updated remote-tracking branches.
            The "git fetch" command is used to pull the updates from remote-tracking branches. Additionally, 
            we can get the updates that have been pushed to our remote branches to our local machines.
