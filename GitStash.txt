What is git stash?

                   git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can
                   work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on.
                   The git stash command takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away 
                   for later use, and then reverts them from your working copy.
